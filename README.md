# Starter project

A typical starter project for Windows and with g++ compilation.

Before starting the project, make sure you have the g++ compiler installed. Use MinGW.

Check out this simple project.

In the `src` directory there is a `main.cpp` file, it contains the initial code and when compiled it outputs `Hello world!`, you can change it as you wish. The `Release.compile.bat` file compiles the `main.cpp` file and the compiled file is in the `Release` directory. And `Release.compile.run.bat` compiles and runs it right away. You can change these two files.

However, the project is small and suitable for beginners. Feel free to develop your project.
