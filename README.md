# Starter project

A typical starter project for Windows and with g++ compilation.

Before starting the project, make sure you have the g++ compiler installed. Use MinGW.

Check out this simple project.

In the `src` directory there is a `main.cpp` file, it contains the initial code and when compiled it outputs `Hello world!`, you can change it as you wish. The `Release.compile.bat` file compiles the `main.cpp` file and the compiled file is in the `Release` directory. And `Release.compile.run.bat` compiles and runs it right away. You can change these two files.

However, the project is small and suitable for beginners. Feel free to develop your project.

But, I recommend choosing an IDE program, it's like Notepad and you edit files, but more advanced. There are several options:
* <b>Visual Studio Code</b>. A powerful development environment developed by Microsoft. A very popular free program.
* <b>CLion</b>. Popular C++ development program. Developed by JetBrains. The program is paid. The trial version is valid for only 30 days.
* <b>Sublime Text</b>. A spacious program, supports all languages. The program is paid, but you can download and use it for free, but for further use you need to purchase a license.
* <b>Code::Blocks</b>. Simple and lightweight IDE for working with C++.
* <b>Dev-C++</b>. An outdated but popular IDE among students.

There are other programs, but I have selected all the popular programs.
