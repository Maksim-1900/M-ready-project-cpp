# Starter project

A typical starter project for Windows and with g++ compilation.

Before starting the project, make sure you have the g++ compiler installed. Use [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/). Go to the [guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/installing-mingw-tools-for-c-c-and-changing-environment-variable/).

Check out this simple project.

In the `src` directory there is a `main.cpp` file, it contains the initial code and when compiled it outputs `Hello world!`, you can change it as you wish. The `Release.compile.bat` file compiles the `main.cpp` file and the compiled file is in the `Release` directory. And `Release.compile.run.bat` compiles and runs it right away. You can change these two files.

However, the project is small and suitable for beginners. Feel free to develop your project.

But, I recommend choosing an IDE program, it's like Notepad and you edit files, but more advanced. There are several options:
* <b>[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)</b>. A powerful development environment developed by Microsoft. A very popular free program.
* <b>[CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)</b>. Popular C++ development program. Developed by JetBrains. The program is paid. The trial version is valid for only 30 days.
* <b>[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)</b>. A spacious program. The program is paid, but you can download and use it for free, but for further use you need to purchase a license.
* <b>[Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/)</b>. Simple and lightweight IDE for working with C++.
* <b>[Dev-C++](https://dev-cpp.com/)</b>. An outdated but popular IDE among students.

There are other programs, but I have selected all the popular programs.
